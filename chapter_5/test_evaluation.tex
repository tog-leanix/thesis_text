\subsection{Test evaluation}
After both test results have been presented, it is now possible to interpret the results. On the one hand, the subjective observation of each test run and, on the other hand, objective data from performance time stamps during the execution of each test run. \\
From the observation perspective, it looks like the systems are behaving quite similarly. A comparison of the objectively collected data with the notes made shows that the observation is reflected in some test runs. Recognizable by the large bars for locating the data table. As well as the small bars. \\
One point where the subjective feel differs from the objective data is where the test users entered a new data entry. Even there, the observations note that it was faster when the application did not implement the SDS. It turns out that users entered data an average of 8 seconds faster. This is a key indicator that the design system is helping the user with form consistency. Somehow the user was able to insert data into the form 25\% faster. \\
The data collected via the buttons correspond to subjective perception. Users quickly skip the table view to enter new data through the form. This shows, however, that an application implements buttons that are instantly recognized by the user. \\
But not only the form is an indicator that a design system helps the user to complete his tasks faster, but also the implemented navigation bar seems different than in the application without the \ac{SDS}. Here it is again important that the user finds and uses the navigation bar more quickly on average. \\

In conclusion from the tests, even if one tries to implement the exact same application from the look and feel, the consistency of a design system inside helps the user to get the job done faster. It seems like the test user still experienced small design inconsistencies that show up in the test results. Therefore, a design system definitely helps the developers create consistent user interfaces, even if developers try to stay as consistent as possible when not using one.
