\section{Test results}
This chapter presents the results of the test cases performed in Chapter 4. The test was conducted in an enterprise environment. All test participants use SaaS products in their daily work. A total of 22 test runs were performed. These were divided equally between the two test systems. \\
Test candidates try to fill as many different positions as possible. This helps to give a more general meaning to the data obtained. Table \ref{tab:test_candidates} gives an overview of the selected test candidates. \\

The list contains various positions from operational and lower management, but also some test candidates from higher management. Unfortunately, the majority of the test candidates are from the software development department, which could be related to the relationships of the author of this elaboration. \\
