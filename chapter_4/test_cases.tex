\subsection{Test case}\label{text_case}
A test case helps determine whether a design system created for a common purpose helps users work better with an application. In this elaboration, one test case is performed with two test applications to get better test results. One with \ac{SDS} implemented and one without \ac{SDS}.  \\
Since both systems are visually identical, it is impossible to test them with the same person. The tester would already know how to operate and navigate through the test system by the second run. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a reasonable number of test runs on both systems with approximately the same type of person. By person type in this elaboration is meant what a person does in his daily job, e.g., accountant.  \\
The test provides two results for this elaboration. First is the observation of the test execution for each person. The purpose of this observation is to see how the subject responds to the navigation structure of the web page. How the subject navigates to the next page? Which controls do the users use, whether mouse, keyboard, or other unique controls? Testing is done in person to capture emotions and reactions to the content's appearance and disappearance. At the end of a test run, the subject is asked for additional feedback on the application just tested. With this subjective input, it is possible to assess whether the use of \ac{SDS} affects anything. \\
In addition, the test uses time measurement points in each application. These points provide objective feedback about the time spent on particular views or actions.Furthermore, the applications locate the measurement points in the same place, so comparing both types is possible. In this way, it is feasible to obtain unbiased data for evaluation. \\
In preparation for the test runs, the two applications with and without implementation of the design system are globally available as static web pages. The test person opens one of the two applications and finds a description of the test procedure. The description informs the user that the following application might implement a design system. After the brief introduction, the first view explains the three test steps to the user:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Navigate to the data table containing the records of different companies.
    \item Find the action to create a new data record.
    \item Fill out the form and submit a new entry.
\end{enumerate}

Since users are not given any instructions on navigating to the data table or with what details to fill in the new record, users are free to explore the demo application. The test steps are intentionally vague to allow users to develop their patterns in their interaction.  \\
After reading all the instructions, the applications will ask the users to start the test by clicking the "Start" button below. This interaction will trigger the first measurement point, which is the start of the demo. \\
The interaction also takes the users to the landing page shown in Figure \ref{landing_page}. On this page, users need to figure out how to navigate to the companies' data table. By scanning the view, they should figure out how to use the navigation bar at the top to navigate to the Companies page. When the user clicks on the navigation bar, they will navigate to the data table view and the second measurement point will be triggered. Again, the memory stores the measured time needed. \\
In the second view (Figure \ref{data_table}), the user sees the data table containing the entries. To add a new entry to the data table, the user must click on the "Add +" button in the upper right corner of this view. With pressing the button, the view changes to the third view (Figure \ref{adding_form}). As with the last view change, the user triggers a new measurement point, and the time data stores it in the memory.  \\ 
In the last view, the user fills in the given form and clicks on "Save" to store the data in the table. The action again triggers and saves a measurement point for the test. When saving the new data unit in the table, the user is navigated back to the table and automatically downloads a JSON file containing all the measurement points described. This JSON file is then sent to the author of this elaboration to collect the measurement of each participant. \\

By collecting all the measurement data and observing the user behavior during the interaction, this test case provides much data for evaluation. These final words conclude this chapter and lead to the next chapter, presenting the test results and their evaluation.
