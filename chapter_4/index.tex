\section{Testing the Design System}
With a concept for a design system that is suitable as a basis for \ac{SaaS} products, it can now be tested for its suitability.  \\
The test case should provide insights into the usability for users and developers. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate the presented design system into an application and test it. A comparable application without SDS should also be created. Users will only test one of the systems, as a second run would manipulate the result of the test. The test scenario and test group will be presented later in this chapter. \\
In addition to the general observation of the users, time measurements will also be taken to get an unbiased view of the test runs. With all this data, the SDS can be tested for its practicality in the real world.
