\section{Testing the \acf{SDS}}
Tests prove its suitability with a concept for a design system that is suitable as a basis for \ac{SaaS} products.\\
The test case should provide insights into the usability for users and developers. Therefore, it is necessary to integrate the presented design system into an application and test it. The test also creates a similar application without \ac{SDS}. Users will only test one of the systems, as a second run would manipulate the test result. The test scenario and test group will be presented later in this chapter. \\
In addition to the general observation of the users, time measurements will give an unbiased view of the test runs. Finally, with all this data, an evaluation can show if the \ac{SDS} is practical in the real world.
