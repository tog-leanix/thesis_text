\section{Implementation}
This chapter presents the implementation of the newly created design system as a standard for the web user interfaces for SaaS products. \\
First, a look at the architecture and modelling is taken. This is done by looking at existing design systems and trying to understand and extract requirements in order to develop a common system that fits most products in the SaaS space. \\
Next, this chapter presents the actual implementation of the components, including the technology stack used and how the components are built. \\
Finally, this chapter presents what is required to implement this design system in a software product. It also identifies potential pitfalls to be aware of when using the components of the design system. \\
