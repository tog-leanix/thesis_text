This chapter presents the implementation of the newly created design system as a standard for the web user interfaces for SaaS products. \\
Modeling the architecture of a new design system is the first step. Looking at existing design systems and trying to understand how they work and extract requirements in order to develop a common system that fits most products in the SaaS world. \\
Then, this chapter presents the actual implementation of a component, including the technology stack used and the creation process. \\
The chapter concludes with an explanation of the build chain. How the build process bundles all the components and atoms to make them usable for any project. At the end, an example shows the possibilities to integrate the finished bundle into existing software.
