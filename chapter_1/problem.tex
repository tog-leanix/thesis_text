\subsection{User interfaces in \ac{SaaS} products}
Users are still the primary consumers of \ac{SaaS} products. And that will not change in the next ten years. More and more SaaS products will emerge, and one will be replaced by the other. Depending on what works best for the current use case. The products used in businesses could change from month to month. For users, this means they will have to learn new structures and workflows of each software from scratch again. Of course, there may be tutorials, training, and documentation. But in real life, users learn how to use the software when working with it. \\
An excellent example of this is a blog post by \citeauthor{sernoff_website_2021} that shows how many different implementations of a navigation menu exist. No wonder the sheer amount of variants can confuse users. It may take some time for a user to remember each interaction pattern for each software. And this example refers only to navigation menus.  Usually, user interfaces consist of many different components, which leads to even more confusion when switching between various programs. \\
Therefore, software programs must have similar user interfaces. For comparison: The arrangement of the pedals in motorized vehicles is always the same. Car manufactors always arrange the gas pedal, brake, and clutch in the same order. Thus, the user can drive any vehicle without thinking about how to operate it. Standardization once defined this arrangement, and every vehicle manufacturer must comply. There is also a standard for software user interfaces on how developers should design human interfaces.  ISO/IEC 9241 establishes rules for the ergonomic design of human interaction with computer systems. Unlike the automotive industry, there are no rules for creating user interfaces for software products. Of course, there are exceptions, such as government websites, which must be accessible and meet specific requirements. But no one can force software manufacturers to follow a standard implementation. \\
So the goal is to get software vendors to implement some standardization. Providing another standard that a working group tailors a little better to the use case of \ac{SaaS} products may not be enough. Long standards like ISO/IEC 9241 are often far too complex to understand and don't provide pre-built components. An optimal solution for implementing standardization should be easy to use for those doing the work, who are the developers. \\
Many are familiar with frameworks, templates, or guidelines in the world of web user interface development. They are simple and widely used in the developer community. But is it possible to have something that provides standardization for user interfaces? Such an assistant must be easy for the developer to use. In the best case, the developer doesn't need to know anything about patterns or rule sets when using it. \\
Another question that arises with standardization: Does it even make sense to have a standard for the design and structure of user interfaces of \ac{SaaS} products? Doesn't that lead to a world where every product looks the same? Products want to stand out from one another through their capabilities, style, and handling. Therefore, such an assistant must be customizable to the company's needs. But such a tool should not restrict the freedom of design. The components must have the ability to adapt to the product design. \\
Assuming a tool meets all the requirements, i.e., it is easy to use for development and is customizable enough to stand out from other products. One final question remains: Is a user who works with a product that provides this support more productive? A product with the help of such a tool should enable the user to complete a simple task faster than a product without the tool support. \\
In examining how \ac{SaaS} product companies are trying to align their user interfaces across their entire product portfolio, a new trend is emerging - design systems. So why not use a design system to bring not just one product line but all \ac{SaaS} products into alignment? The \citetitle{uswds_uswds_nodate}, for example, is already trying to unify all government-related software into one design system. So it should be possible to go a step further and standardize an entire type of application with one design system. \\
Many large \ac{SaaS} companies have already developed their design system. The \citetitle{limcaco_design_nodate} website summarizes them in a list. With 104 design systems from various \ac{SaaS} vendors, this seems to be a hot topic with much potential. Researching these design systems, gathering best practices, and building a base design system for all companies could lead to a new kind of standardization through the design system. \\

These chapters make it clear how this elaboration will approach the standardization of user interfaces with the help of design systems. The next chapter first introduces the general topic of design systems. The introduction will be necessary later to understand how the presented design system got its architecture.
