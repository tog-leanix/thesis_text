\section{Introduction}
Standardization in technology is an important topic of great significance. Without standardization, there would be no progress in computer science today. \\
A look at the past shows that the first attempt at standardization was made in the 18th century. During the industrial revolution, standards were urgently needed to align and reliably connect machines. Thus, the first known standard was created with the screw and nut. Building on this, technology was able to spread and develop rapidly during this time. \cite{wiki_standardization_2022} \\
Today, no one thinks about the specification of a bolt or a nut when they use it. That is the goal of standardization. Forget about things that have already been thought about. Topics can move much faster if people can  focus on the relevant work. \\


Speaking of technology, a new star has risen in recent years, namely Software as a Service. In the last five years, the number of SaaS products used in companies has increased tenfold. \cite{stastista_saas_2021} At this high rate, the need for standardization to align software is pressing. Naturally, when thinking about alignment, a software architect thinks about connecting systems via application interfaces. These interfaces are often well documented and offer a variety of options. But what about maybe the most important interface of a software, the user interface?
