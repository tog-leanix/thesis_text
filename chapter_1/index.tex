\section{Introduction}
Standardization in technology is an important topic of great significance. Without standardization, there would be no progress in computer science today. \\
A look at the past shows that the first attempt at standardization was made in the 18th century. During the industrial revolution, standards were urgently needed to align and reliably connect machines. Thus, the first known standard was created with the screw and nut. Building on this, technology was able to spread and develop rapidly during this time. \cite{wiki_standardization_2022} \\
Today, no one thinks about the specification of a bolt or a nut when they use it. That is the goal of standardization. Forget about things that have already been thought about. Topics can move much faster if people can  focus on the relevant work. \\
