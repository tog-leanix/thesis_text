\section{Introduction}
Standardization in technology is an essential topic of great significance. Without standardization, there would be no progress in computer science today. \\
A look at the past shows that inventors made the first attempt at standardization in the 18th century. During the industrial revolution, standards were urgently needed to align and reliably connect machines. Thus, engineers created the first known standard with the screw and nut. With this invention, technology started to spread and develop rapidly during this time.  \cite{wiki_standardization_2022} \\
Today, no one thinks about the specification of a bolt or a nut when they use it. Standardization aims to reduce the demand for specific intstructions and increase time for critical tasks. \\
